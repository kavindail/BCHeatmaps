**Frontend Setup Instructions**

## Prerequisites:

Before setting up the frontend, please ensure that the backend has been set up and is running. Follow the instructions in the backend section of the README to set up Docker, build the images, and pull the necessary data to populate the database. This is critical to ensure the frontend works properly with the backend.
