**Frontend Setup Instructions**

## Prerequisites:

Before setting up the frontend, please ensure that the backend has been set up and is running. Follow the instructions in the backend section of the README to set up Docker, build the images, and pull the necessary data to populate the database. This is critical to ensure the frontend works properly with the backend.

npm install

After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the frontend server in development mode:

Once the server is up and running, open your browser and navigate to the provided localhost link to view the frontend application in action!
